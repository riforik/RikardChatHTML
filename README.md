## Getting Started

Rikard Bot serves as a personal HTML bot that provides custom commands relative to the creators needs.
These instructions will help you get started..

### Prerequisites

A code environment & browser of choice


### Installing

Download a zip of the master branch or clone it to your local.

Extract the folder to any location.

After downloading and extracting to your chosen directory, open the files
in your code environment to start editing


#### I developed this with:

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) - Used for browser access
* [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) - For creating the chat bot


#### NOTED: Only the levels will work with data from MY PERSONAL databases, you must add your own connection settings to port from your db of choice.

Get to editing and show me what you can do!
